# Project-1---Corn-v.-Weather
Corn v Weather
Our project is to examine how weather impacts corn prices.  We will examine: whether temperature affects corn prices; what weather type has the largest impact (positive price and negative price); and what weather type has the least impact on prices.  We also look at the differences between States.  Iowa, Indiana and Illinois are the three largest producers of corn.  We will see if there are differences between the prices they receive for the corn that they produce.  Does the weather in one area affect the corn price in another?
We will use Open Weather API and USDA API (https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api)
