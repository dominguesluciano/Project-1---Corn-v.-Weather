# Project-1: Corn vs Weather

## Corn vs Weather

Our project examines how weather impacts on corn prices (US territory).

We will examine:

* _whether temperature affects corn prices_
* _what weather type has the largest impact (positive price and negative price)_
* _what weather type has the least impact on prices_
* _We also look at the differences between States_ 

Iowa, Indiana and Illinois are known for being the three largest producers of corn.

We will also see if:

* _are there differences between the prices they receive for the corn that they produce?_
* _does the weather in one area affect the corn price in another?_

## APIs

We will use the following APIs:

* _Open Weather API (https://openweathermap.org/api)_ 
* _USDA - United Stated Department of Agriculture API (https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api)_
